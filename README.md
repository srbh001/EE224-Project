# EE224-Project

**Project Statement** : 
Design a computing system, IITB-CPU, whose instruction set architecture is provided. Use VHDL as HDL to implement. IITB-CPU is a 16-bit very simple computer developed for the teaching purpose. The IITB-CPU is an 8-register, 16-bit computer system, i.e., it can process 16 bits at a time. It should use point-to-point communication infrastructure. 

IITB-CPU is a 16-bit very simple computer developed for the teaching that is based on the Little Computer Architecture. The IITB-CPU is an 8-register, 16-bit computer system. It has 8 general-purpose registers (R0 to R7). Register R7 is always stores Program Counter. PC points to the next instruction. All addresses are short word addresses (i.e., address 0 corresponds to the first two bytes of main memory, address 1 corresponds to the second two bytes of main memory, etc.). This architecture uses condition code register which has two flags Carry flag (c) and Zero flag (z). The IITB-CPU is very simple, but it is general enough to solve complex problems.
